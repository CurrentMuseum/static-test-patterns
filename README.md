# The Current Museum
## Static Test Patterns Website

We are a non-profit institution devoted to electronic media. Our mission is to create experiences that showcase, study, and preserve work by digitally-bold artists who engage technology to expand the boundaries of creative expression.

This website is a test of our new branding by Project Projects for our Test Patterns show in Nov/Dec of 2016.
